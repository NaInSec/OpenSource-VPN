# Configure OpenVPN Clients

[OpenVPN clients](https://openvpn.net/vpn-client/) are available for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android and Linux. macOS users can also use [Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net).

To add a VPN connection, first securely transfer the generated `.ovpn` file to your device, then open the OpenVPN App and import the VPN profile.

To manage OpenVPN clients, run the install script again: `sudo bash openvpn.sh`.
